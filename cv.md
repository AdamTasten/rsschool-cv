3. I've explored different IT jobs, and i've decided to develop skills in front-end web development, because already in school i was interested in web development, and i've learned how to create web sites, so i'm a bit experienced with HTML and CSS.
4. I learned different programming languages such as **C++**, **Java**, **C#** as part of programming courses at the Belarusian State University. For C# project i have used git system, WinForms, created activity and use case UML diagrams.
